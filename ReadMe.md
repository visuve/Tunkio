# Tunkio

- Wipes files or unallocated volumes
- Originally written during the small hours of a boring night, since improved a lot
- Does not yet even try to be secure, done simply out of curiosity

## TODO

- Add support to wipe directories
- Implement the intended wiping modes
- Try to limit the CreateFile flags as low as possible
- Attempt to try recovering files after the wipe

## Prerequisites
