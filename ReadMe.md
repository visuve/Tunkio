# WinDiskWipe

- Wipes an unallocated hard disk drive
- Written during the small hours of a boring night
- Does not even try to be secure, done simply out of curiosity

## TODO

- Try to limit the CreateFile flags as low as possible
- Attempt to try recovering files after the wipe

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2017 with latest updates
